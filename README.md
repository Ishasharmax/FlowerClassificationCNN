# Flower Classification using CNN

## Description of the project/task
This main aim from this project is to solve a Supervised Image Classification problem of recognizing the flower types - rose, chamomile, dandelion, sunflower, & tulip. In the end, we’ll have a trained model which can predict the class of the flower using a Machine Learning algorithm, the Neural Networks. We will specifically use Flowers Recognition dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 5 classes of flower species, each having about 800 images. So, we’ve a total of 4242 images to train our model with.

## Evaluation plan
For our evaluation plan, we’re thinking of using the Convolutional Neural Network for image recognition. Below are the links from where we have retrieved information about Image recognition, CNN, and Logistic Regression, which will act as a classifier.
