# Flower Classification using CNN

## Description of the project/task
The main aim from this project is to understand how to use Deep Learning models to solve a Supervised Image Classification problem of recognizing the flower types - rose, chamomile, dandelion, sunflower, & tulip. In the end, we’ll have a trained model which can predict the class of the flower using a Machine Learning algorithm, the Neural Networks. We will specifically use Flowers Recognition dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 5 classes of flower species, each having about 800 images. So, we’ve a total of 4242 images to train our model with.

## Evaluation plan
For our evaluation plan, we’re thinking of using the Convolutional Neural Network for image recognition. Below are the links from where we have retrieved information about Image recognition, CNN, and Logistic Regression, which will act as a classifier.

## Why Keras?
Keras is an amazing library to quickly start Deep Learning, as it offers simple understandable functions and syntax to start building Deep Neural Nets right away instead of worrying too much on the programming part. Keras is a wrapper for Deep Learning libraries namely Theano and TensorFlow.

## Dependencies
The following Python packages are used to do the project:

TensorFlow - Backend engine to run keras on top of it.
Pandas - A data science tool used with Python for data wrangling & analysis, mainly of tabularised data.
Keras - It's a wrapper for Deep Learning libraries namely TensorFlow and to build Deep Neural Nets.
NumPy - It is used for different mathematical & data manipulation operations.
Matplotlib - It is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
Seaborn - It is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
Scikit-learn - A framework to build several machine learning models.

## Conclusion
- To learn to use the pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Nets to extract features from the images with keras.
- To learn how to make use of different python libraries like NumPy & Matplotlib for complex data manipulation tasks and mathematical operations.
- To learn how to design several machine learning models, test their accuracies & compare them while avoiding overfitting with the help of cross validation techniques.
